pub const EXALTED_HEALING: &str = "Given enough time, the character will always heal fully with no lasting trauma or chronic condition. \
    This cannot restore a limb that is fully detached or destroyed, but all other injuries will heal, usually without even a scar. \
    All Exalts possess this merit automatically, as do all spirits (including gods, ghosts, elementals, demons, and Fair Folk).";
